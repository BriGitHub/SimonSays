# SimonSays
This is a game made in Python based off Simon Says that uses a user's number pad for interaction. I made this project in 2017 with a fellow classmate.
It is designed to help players improve their memory skills. It is the same basic concept of Simon Says in which you copy the pattern randomly created by the computer but in my version, the squares will randomly flash and then each round you properly repeat the sequence increases by one new square. The player sets how many rounds they would like to play at the beginning and a window also pops up explaining the rules to the player. If the player properly completes the set amount of rounds, they will receive a victory screen. However, if they type in the wrong number or it is in the wrong order, the player will receive a game over screen but they can choose to retry.
