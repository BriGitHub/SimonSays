"""
This is the final version of the game, I hope you enjoy
The game now has a background color, a different window title, text on the main screen with the gameâ€™s title and
a key at the bottom, a game over and victory screen that plays music and tells the user how many rounds they got
to, new screen for input so the user does not need to type in the console, pop-up to start the game that includes
brief instructions, a retry button when they lose, and adds a pop-up that asks the user how many rounds they
would like to play.
